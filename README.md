## 1. Tello Drone Project

The objective is to study the Tello Drone Programming using 2 programming tools and 1 mission.

The programming tools I use is Python and Golang.

For Python, We use djitellopy to control the drone and open-cv for open the camera in the drone.

For Golang, We use gobot to control the drone with algorithms.

The mission that I gave to the drone is to control the drone with the gesture tracking.

## 2. Shor's Algorithm (Quantum Computing)

The objective is to study the encryption concept and Shor's Algorithm that can Brute-Force algorithms within a minute.

First, we need to talk about the encryption and type of the encryption.
Second, we will talk about the basic of Quantum Computing such as Qubit, Quantum Circuits, Quantum Theory
Lastly, we will talk about how to implement the Shor's algorithm in the classical computing way.

The bonus for this track is I want to implement the Grover's algorithm to solve the index-finding in unsorted list.

## 3. SNN algorithm (Neuromorphic Computing)
